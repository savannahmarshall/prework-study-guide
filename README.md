# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## My motivation is to create a study guide that can be used to help me organize what I have learned about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript in the prework sections of this course. I built this project to prepare for our course and keep me organized. It solves the problem of taking notes. I learned the basics of each section, how to debug and started building a foundation for myself as I learn how to code. It will also provide an example of my first webpage and coding project as this is all brand new to me.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used by navigating between the four different sections which contain notes about different topics. HTML, JavaScripe, Git and CSS all have their own sections which highlight the different things I learned about each topic. You can open the DevTools console by right clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect". From there, nativate to the "console" tab on the top of the page and you can see the JavaScript running.There will be a list of topics I learned from the prework.
